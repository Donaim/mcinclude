# To do
- [x] faster project compilations: split compilation and linking with scripts
- [ ] make possible with mcincluder to generate precompiled headers for each individual file. Because now only possible that only first header can be precompiled which is silly
- [ ] call mxxbuild from runtest directly (`import mxxbuild`)
- [ ] make possible to imitate classes (and inheritance) in C with mcinclude

# What ive learned
- always split .h and .cpp
- use forward-declarations as much as possible
